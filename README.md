This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Live Application](https://m-mansoor-ali.github.io/react-room/)

I developed this little application while I was learning React in my free time.
I was also exploring the MQTT protocol at that time, so I decided to combine the two together.
It uses eclipse iot's mqtt server over web socket to pub/sub a topic `react-room`.
